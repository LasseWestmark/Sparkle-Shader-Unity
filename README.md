## About

After looking for a sparkle/glitter shader implementation and only finding [THIS](http://developer.amd.com/wordpress/media/2012/10/Shopf-Procedural.pdf) pdf from AMD (Page 22).
I found the AMD implementation lacking as it is grid based which is clearly visible in my opinion, so I decided to roll my own.

Three example shaders is included

Example shader 1: Only sparkles.

Example shader 2: Sparkles combined with a barebones diffuse+specular setup

Example shader 3: Sparkles combined with reflection and refraction for a bit of fancyness

## Demo
